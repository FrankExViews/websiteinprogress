    <h1>What is Roller Derby?</h1>
    <p>
    Roller derby is a contact sport played on roller skates. Two teams of five players skate on an oval track, with each team designating one player as the "jammer" who scores points by lapping members of the opposing team.<br>
    
    The other players, called "blockers," use their bodies to block the opposing jammer and help their own jammer score points. Points are also scored by the jammer if they pass members of the opposing team. The game consists of multiple "jams" in which both teams send their jammer out to score points, and is typically a very physical and fast-paced sport.

   <h1>What are the Rules?</h1> 
<br>        
The rules of roller derby can vary depending on the league or organization, but some common rules include:
        
<ul>
<li>A game consists of multiple "jams," which are two-minute periods during which both teams send their jammer out to score points.</li>

<li>Each team has five players on the track at a time, including one jammer and four blockers.</li>

<li>The jammer is the player designated to score points by lapping members of the opposing team. They wear a helmet cover with a star on it to indicate their role.</li>

<li>The blockers use their bodies to block the opposing jammer and help their own jammer score points.</li>

<li>Points are scored when the jammer passes members of the opposing team.</li>

<li>Players must wear protective gear, including helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards.</li>

<li>Illegal actions such as tripping, elbowing, or pushing from behind are not allowed and can result in penalties or expulsion from the game.</li>

<li>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li>

<li>The rules of the track, such as how many players are allowed in the penalty box, the maximum number of penalties that can be accumulated by a team before they are forced to play short-handed, and the rules for calling off the jam are also subject to league variation.    
    </li>
 </ul>
